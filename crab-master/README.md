  Crab is a ﬂexible, fast recommender engine for Python that integrates classic information ﬁltering recom- 
  mendation algorithms in the world of scientiﬁc Python packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib). The engine aims 
  to provide a rich set of components from which you can construct a customized recommender system from a 
  set of algorithms.
